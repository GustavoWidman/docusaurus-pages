# Who is GustavoWidman?

GustavoWidman, also known as Gustavo Wagon Widman or r3dlust is a aspiring computer engineer, studying at INTELI!

## What does he do there?

Aside from playing League of Legends, he is involved in the development of 4 projects every single year, each dedicated to an individual company. He also performs individual projects aswell as taking up freelancing opportunities!

## r3dlust.com????

Why yes, there is a r3dlust.com and it is registered under Gustavo's name. He personally manages it and deploys his own projects over there however he has yet to put something on the main domain and only hosts micro services in some subdomains. Some of the fun things he's deployed include a private File Hosting service (files.r3dlust.com), a Link Shortening service (links.r3dlust.com), a private Pterodactyl Panel (pterodactyl.r3dlust.com) for hosting game servers and a Mail Server/Web Inbox so that he can send emails from r3dlust.com (registrations are off currently due to limited disk space on the VPS!)

## League of Legends player?

Again, yes! Gustavo likes to play league of legends quite a lot, especially in the support role, maining the character Xerath!
